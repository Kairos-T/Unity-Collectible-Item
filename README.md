# Collectible Item Collection Script

## Overview
This C# Unity script is designed to handle the collection of items marked as "Collectible" in a game environment. When the player's GameObject comes into contact with a collectible item, the item is destroyed and an audio clip associated with the item is played. The script also supports the use of an AudioSource to play the audio.

## Features
- Detects collisions with GameObjects tagged as "Collectible".
- Plays an audio clip associated with the collectible item on collision.
- Destroys the collectible item after playing the audio clip.

## Instructions
1. Attach the `Collect` script to the GameObject that should be collecting items.
2. Make sure the GameObject has an AudioSource component to play audio.
3. Assign the GameObject's AudioSource to the script's `my_audio` field in the Unity Inspector if not done automatically.
4. Tag the GameObjects that should be collected as "Collectible".
5. Attach an AudioSource component to the collectible GameObject if you want a specific audio to play upon collection.

## Example Usage
1. Create a GameObject (e.g., player character) and attach an AudioSource component to it.
2. Attach the `Collect` script to the player GameObject.
3. Assign the player's AudioSource to the `my_audio` field in the script's Inspector.
4. Create collectible GameObjects (e.g., coins, power-ups) and tag them as "Collectible".
5. Optionally, attach an AudioSource component to each collectible GameObject and assign an audio clip.
6. Play the game and observe that when the player GameObject collides with a collectible, the collectible is destroyed, and its audio is played.

## Notes
- Ensure that the collectible GameObjects have colliders and rigidbodies for collision detection.
- This script assumes that the collectible item has an AudioSource component to play audio.
